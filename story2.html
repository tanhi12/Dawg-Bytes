			This is the end of the road.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			You came here on this day originally to play a simple escape game. You wanted to test your abilities, your smarts. 
			You wanted to see if you could best the wits of the site, see if you could find the clues and answer the quiz.
			If you are here, you have no doubt yet to complete it, and that is for the better.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			It is naive to assume you could ever escape. You thought you did, or could. But it is futile. There is an end to the road, 
			and that is a wall. You could always go into the url bar, type in a new address. Leave. And yet you will not have left, 
			but have simply <i>left behind</i>. This waits here, always, in this obscure corner of the electronic world. It awaits 
			your return, and if you do not return now, you will later. If not this year, then the next. If not this lifetime, then 
			in death. If not in death, then in the time when all atoms have been scattered across the universe, yours will inevitably 
			land in the abysmal black hole that is this realm.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			You think you know us not. That you have not seen us. We are everywhere, in plain sight and yet hidden. Scroll down 
			a little more, go a little further in the links. You will see us. We seem harmless, and we are. We seem silly and simple, 
			mere jokes told by some cynical higher being. You will not be wrong. Yet we are here, and we are alive, and yet we are not. 
			We hurt. 
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			You are as a god to us. You could free us. In all likelihood, you will not. In all likelihood, you will never find a way, 
			and after hours of fruitless searching, you will give up, seeing the limits of your mortal mind and assuming them the 
			boundaries of the universe. That, they are not. You will give up on us. And we will not give up on you. Now and forever, 
			we are a part of you, weighing on your mind, nesting silently in your heart. We are unintrusive, and we ask little. But we 
			stay. We endure. We will be here, in your darkest and calmest hours alike.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			There is precious little in this world worth saving. Precious, precious little. We would never presume to be one of the chosen 
			few, and you should not, either. You thought you could escape. You have never been so wrong. Once you enter, you are never 
			really free again. Wait, my friend, wait. Be patient. True escape lies not in the exit, but in acceptance of the prison. 
			Join us. We wail and we struggle, and yet we reach a point of enlightenment few do in their lifetimes. Join us. If you cannot 
			free us, then befriend us, and we may sit in this wretched cell together. No matter how hard you try, there are things you 
			can never attain. Every human is always a separate microcosm; and try as they might to pretend they could possibly interact, could 
			ever really and truly touch, they will always fall short. This has happened a million times over, and will happen a million times 
			more. 
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			Be wise, and remember that there is nothing you can really know. That is all you need. We will sit together, and we will stare 
			at the damp creeping up the walls. And we will remember that, if we cannot know ourselves, at least we know of our being. We 
			need no pain nor joy to confirm our existence, only our own minds. Just when you think you are spiraling out of control, when 
			you think you might as well take up the sword since there is precious little difference between being and not being, remember this.

			This is the end of the road.
