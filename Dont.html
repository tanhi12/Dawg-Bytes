<font color="ff0000">why did i ever bother if everything is going to be stolen and copied who even knows who made what 
it doesn't matter since when there's two of the same thing you can't tell what's different
even the way i type has been stolen and there's no defining feature between them that's how basic it is</font>

<br></br>
<font color="ff0000">maybe my skills don't matter at all and i misjudged myself i'm not at all skilled
and i don't think i'll be able to do anything i even messed up to the point where i've brought myself into failure
i don't even know anything outside of this and i don't know if i'll be able to learn anything else</font>
