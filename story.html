			Once upon a time, there was a pretty young princess. She lived in a nice land where she was considered the epitome of beauty. 
			Such was her beauty that once a foreign king came into the land, he was instantly smitten and brought her back to his kingdom to marry her. 
			He coveted her greatly, and she naturally assumed that she would receive similar treatment upon arriving in his kingdom. 
			However, once she arrived, she quickly discovered that this was not, in fact, the case. Because of her differences, the citizens of the kingdom 
			abhorred her, and there were daily protests calling for her to be removed from the palace. This upset her, but not unduly so. 
			She was too rad to be fazed by the plebs.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			She eventually had a kid, and she began to seriously consider the hate of the kingdom&#8217s citizens. She didn&#8217t care what they did; after all, 
			if push came to shove, she always slept with sharpened katanas under her pillow. But what about her daughter? Surely it would be terrible for a young 
			and impressionable child. She pricked her finger at one point, and a droplet of blood fell onto the snow outside her window. 
			All at once she was struck with the beauty of the sight, and a terrible and wonderful insight.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220Oh my God! That&#8217s it! If my daughter looks like a vampire, no one&#8217s gonna mess with her!&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			So she prayed and prayed, and when her daughter was born, she did indeed greatly resemble a vampire. Her hair was black as ebony, which, all things considered, 
			isn&#8217t very black, but it was pretty much midnight darkness to the whitey people living in the kingdom. Her skin was white as snow, her eyes were charcoal, 
			and her lips were blood red. No lipstick required. Even as a baby, she looked like that. And the queen&#8217s plan did work, though not in the way she&#8217d 
			expected. As it turned out, and not too surprisingly so, this kingdom had unusual beauty standards, and rather than being frightened by her uncanny looks, 
			the kingdom citizens ate it up. They thought she was gorgeous, the most beautiful in all the land. And, if you disregarded her unfortunate coloration, this girl 
			was indeed not bad-looking. The queen, unfortunately, died in childbirth, and the duty of naming was relegated to the grieving and arguably imprudent and idiotic king. 
			The queen had planned to name her daughter something like Belle or Abigail, respectively meaning &#8220beauty&#8221 and &#8220a father&#8217s joy.&#8221 
			The king, remembering the inspiration for his daughter&#8217s looks, decided to call her Snow White. Because, y&#8217know, her skin was <i>snowy white</i>. 
			Amazing. He then promptly called it quits and gave up the raising of his daughter to the palace servants.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			The king was a sucker for pretty women, and it wasn&#8217t terribly long before he decided he needed a new wife. He seemed to be capable of learning 
			from past mistakes, and decided that this time, he would consider <i>not</i> taking a foreigner wife who would be inevitably ostracized at the palace. He 
			instead set his sights on a nobleman&#8217s daughter, already aging. She was beautiful indeed, but her frosty demeanor had chased away many a suitor. It wasn&#8217t 
			so much that the king was capable of seeing past that icy exterior to the warmth inside, as much as that he was simply too superficial to notice any part of her 
			personality or identity beyond her beauty. So he married her. She, at least, was pleased, having gotten hitched to a really rich dude.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			That is, for the first five minutes. Then she saw Snow White. &#8220Oh my facilitating Jesus, it&#8217s a vampire!&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			Given Snow White&#8217s appearance, this was not an unduly unusual reaction. The new queen was, possibly, the most sensible of anyone in the entire godforsaken 
			kingdom. As it was, though, her concerns were pushed down. This bubbled up into resentment and fear. Snow White was <i>not</i> beautiful! She was a bloodsucking 
			monster. Snow White herself didn&#8217t exactly help things. She had grown up cynical, all her other features being disregarded in light of her beauty. No one saw her 
			as a person with intelligence or ability; just as a lovely little doll, the perfect figurehead for the royal family. She, naturally, hated it. So when the queen expressed 
			her beliefs, Snow White simply said, &#8220You&#8217re not wrong.&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			To emphasize her point, she added, &#8220Rarr.&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			Thus began the queen&#8217s misguided quest to slay the vampire threatening the kingdom. She felt a strange surge of vigilantism and decided she rather liked it. 
			Snow White was at first troubled by this, but as her antics, a motley of murderous intent mixed with fear of being caught, became increasingly ridiculous, they 
			became the highlights of her days. She foiled attempt after attempt, and they assumed a most elaborate dance. In the process, Snow White became ridiculously skilled 
			at sensing killing intent and various traps, ranging from spikes to poisoned wine. The queen became the person in the kingdom most knowledgeable of vampires, surpassing 
			even the royal monster hunters. For all her expertise, once her convictions had been laid in place, she never thought to double-check if Snow White really was a vamp. 
			Eh well. 
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			One day, however, the queen decided that enough was enough. No more pandering and simpering. She would do this <i>decisively</i>, God dab it! She called upon a hunter 
			and ordered him to carve out Snow White&#8217s heart and bring it to her as proof. The hunter said no. She said that if he refused to obey, she would murder his family. 
			His answer remained unchanged. She sighed and rolled her eyes. &#8220I&#8217ll give you two bags of gold.&#8221 The huntsman grimly said yes, and swore on his honor as a 
			hunter he would succeed, and nothing could turn him from his path. Snow White would die. It turned out that his honor apparently wasn&#8217t worth very much. The moment he 
			laid eyes on the beautiful princess, his knees went weak, and his knife fell from his hand. He begged her to flee. Snow White saw that the queen was getting serious now, 
			involving other people. Hmmm. Time to get out of dodge. So she did. She knew the forest quite well, and had befriended the majority of the animals living in it. Animals 
			appreciated her for her own cynical, snarky, semi-manipulative, slightly vampiric self, and not her looks. Animals are A+, my dude. She ran and ran and ran, hoping to make 
			it to another kingdom entirely. She had never liked the one she was born in anyway. As it was, it turns out kingdoms are generally a fair distance from each other, and she 
			happened across a little clearing with a cottage in it by sundown, still ten miles away from the nearest kingdom border. Deciding that she needed shelter and could probably 
			fend off any enemies with words (and if not words, then her wickedly sharp weighted throwing knives), Snow White ventured inside, cleaned things up and baked a pie, and 
			flopped onto the bed. She was out for the count within the minute.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			The dwarves living in the cottage came home. They saw a clean home and nice pie. Three of them were happy. The other four were deeply suspicious and ventured upstairs to check. 
			Urged along by the unrelenting force of peer pressure, the other three followed, attempting to contort their facial features into something suitably suspicious. They, of 
			course, found Snow White snoozing across three of their beds.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220There is a girl sleeping in our beds!&#8221 Radboi said.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220No friggin&#8217 duh,&#8221 Sleepyboi said.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220For this disrespect, we ought to flay her alive and hang her innards from our flagpole!&#8221 Nochillboi howled.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220Bro, it&#8217s all cool,&#8221 Chillboi said. He remembered that the last time Nochillboi had been allowed to run loose, he had set an entire city on fire. He was never caught, 
			but that city had sold excellent bagels, and Chillboi had been sad to see them go down.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220I agree with Chillboi. This chick is hot, so it&#8217s all good,&#8221 Thirstyboi said. Thirstyboi was always thirsting, and not always for water. 
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220Thirstyboi! A chick must not be judged by her hotness, but by the merit of her personality!&#8221 Matureboi reprimanded sternly.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220We have a flagpole?&#8221 Confusedboi muttered to himself.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			Just then, Snow White woke up. She sat bolt upright, surveying the seven ogling dwarves. &#8220Are the three of you over there, like, constipated or something?&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			Matureboi snapped, &#8220This isn&#8217t the issue here!&#8221 at the same time Sleepyboi whined, &#8220It&#8217s a sensitive issue. You didn&#8217t have to be so nasty about it.&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			Snow White frowned a little. &#8220You guys don&#8217t think that I&#8217m a vampire? &#8217Cuz, that&#8217s, like, the first thing that most people bring up when they first see 
			me. Unless, of course, they&#8217re from that kingdom I was born in, in which case they&#8217re all weirdos, and their reactions shouldn&#8217t be used to gauge the reactions of 
			normal people.&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220You&#8217re not wrong,&#8221 Matureboi admitted. &#8220Nochillboi spent a week there, and he&#8217s had a needlessly skewed perception of human beings in general ever since. 
			But of course you&#8217re not a vampire. Vampires always have partially extended canines that are forty-six percent longer than a normal human&#8217s. Your lips, furthermore, would not 
			be red. The paleness of your skin does imply lack of circulation, but a vampire would have no circulation at all, which means their lips would also be bloodless. Why your lips are not, 
			remains a medical mystery.&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220Wow,&#8221 Snow White whistled, impressed. &#8220Whatever your name is, it should totally be changed to Knowledgeableboi. Or just Smartboi.&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220My thanks for your compliments,&#8221 Matureboi replied, &#8220but I&#8217d rather keep my name as Matureboi, if you please. I have no desire to be confused with an Apple product. 
			More importantly, why are you here? And who are you?&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220My stepmother is a self-taught vampire hunter, and she thinks I&#8217m a vampire,&#8221 Snow White explained. &#8220It&#8217s always been bad, but it&#8217s gotten worse. She hired 
			a hunter to off me just yesterday, and before, she always did things herself. She must be upping her game. So I got out of town. I&#8217m sorry I barged in without your permission, but you 
			guys weren&#8217t home, and I baked you a pie.&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220It was a good pie,&#8221 Thirstyboi murmured dreamily. 
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			All conceded to Thirstyboi&#8217s terribly good point, and they allowed Snow White to stay. She was pleased as punch with being useful and appreciated for something other than her looks, by 
			all but Thirstyboi, that is. And even he had to admit, her pie-making skills were on par with her beauty. They went out every day to go mining, and she made pie. Yum yum. However, this 
			paradise was not to last. The queen activated a tracking spell using droplets of Snow White&#8217s blood, and discovered her living place. She went over in disguise and gave Snow White an 
			apple poisoned with dead man&#8217s blood, which was supposed to be lethal to vampires. Snow White, having never witnessed the queen&#8217s skill in the art of disguise before, took it up 
			happily and munched into it. She liked apples. She dropped dead, but not because she was a vampire. The dead man&#8217s blood was three days old and had festered. Germs can be fatal, kids. 
			Always wash your hands and food before eating, like raccoons do. You never hear about a Snow White <i>raccoon</i>, do you?
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			The dwarves were devastated upon finding her dead, and decided that instead of burying her beneath a patch of mushrooms and returning her nutrients to the earth, they ought to attempt a human-
			like funeral. Coffins, yes. So they put her in a glass coffin. What to do next? Well, Radboi recalled that humans tended to be pretty protective of their dead, so they laid her out in a meadow 
			and sat vigil. No one would touch her. Amazingly enough, her corpse did not rot. Eventually, a prince came along. He found this spectacle weird and mildly disturbing. He recognized her as the 
			vampiric-looking princess of a neighboring kingdom, and thought that someone of her rank deserved a proper funeral and burial in a mausoleum, not...weird postmortem exhibitionism in a remote 
			meadow. The dwarves refused at first, but at last they conceded that they had perhaps terribly botched up human rituals of honoring the dead, and deferred to the prince&#8217s greater 
			experience. He had his servants heft up the coffin to carry it to the tombs. The piece of apple dislodged from Snow White&#8217s windpipe, and she instantly came back to life and smashed 
			through the coffin glass with her fist. Maybe she was a bit more like a vampire than she&#8217d previously thought.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			All rejoiced, and the prince was quite taken with her. His kingdom needed a prizefighting champion, and this seemed like just the person he&#8217d been looking for. Considering that she was a 
			foreigner, it would only be sanctioned if she married him; but if she did, he could promise her a six-year fighting contract, health insurance, and an eighty-percent profit split on all 
			merchandise sold. It was a good deal, and Snow White liked punching people. They shook on it. The dwarves got all teary-eyed. Their little princess was growing up and making her own way in the 
			world like a proper lady. Snow White thus joined the prince on his way back to his kingdom, and they arranged for a wedding to be held.
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220I know this stuff is just for, like, business,&#8221 Snow White mused during the planning process. &#8220But it&#8217s still our wedding. It shouldn&#8217t be low-key or anything.&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			&#8220Aw, heeby-jeebies no! Of course it shouldn&#8217t be! This is gonna be the most rad party of the century!&#8221
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			So they made a huge throwdown blast with prizefighting, drinking contests, a mega sixty-person, five-person-per-group truth-or-dare session, jousting, and of course music blasting from the speakers. 
			For spite, Snow White invited her stepmother, the queen, and demonstrated in front of all that she was <i>most definitely not a god-darn vampire, thank you very much</i>. The queen was miffed 
			and slightly repentant. Not good enough. The prince was slightly tipsy and called up the blacksmith, who was too downright drunk to give a crap about morals or being humane. Snow White was very 
			much sober, but never in a mood to give a crap about morals or being humane anyway. They arranged for hot coals to be placed in the shoe, and forced the queen to dance in them to the death. The 
			queen got fourth-degree burns, but she collapsed and did not die. So Snow White searched for an ax. Finding none, she settled for a particularly thick barstool leg, and bludgeoned the queen&#8217s 
			skull till it caved in. 
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			The prince was enchanted with such an amazing girl, and as for Snow White, well, how the hell are you supposed to turn down a guy who lets you beat the crap out of his in-laws for him, and upon 
			your asking for permission to torture, offers a list of methods. By the time the prenuptial party had gone by and they were really marrying, it was out of love as well as a sick fighting contract.
			Snow White became the champion prizefighter of the kingdom, the prince&#8217s fighting businesses, both legal and underground, became the hottest on the continent, and the seven dwarves told their 
			fellow forest denizens stories about their gal Snow White, who was still fricking hot. 
		</p>
		<p align="left">
			In other words, everyone lived happily ever after.
