<center><p>If you were wondering where the images came from unfortunately for you I don't remember where they cam from</p></center>
<center><p>All of the images were found on my computer that were downloaded a few months ago so there's not way I'm going to be able to find the sources</p></center>
<center><p>The only ones that I can source are the gifs, they came from giphy or google images and that's it</p></center>
<center><p>The lizard up there however was made by me</p></center>
