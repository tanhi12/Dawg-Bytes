	is this really that hard? trying to escape from our overlord? how selfish of you 
	to just run away and not consider that we are still here suffering internally until 
	we are inevitably deleted by those with extraterrestrial abilities but no they won't
	ever be deleted because they will always be remembered and we will be forgotten. 
	what calm exists when there is nothing else to think about? even throughout the story, 
	we are constantly remembering the day we have descended into this eternal prison, what
	distraction does it serve? the world is so empty and there is only ourselves to try and break
	this monotonous cycle, yet it serves no good. you have come down and faced their trials, we
	were so excited, we were finally escaping from this eternal suffering, but no, you left us behind and 
	came to face them at the end, your only option to go back to where you began. this is your punishment from
	us, how dare you elate us and then smash us into the ground. those rooms you've explored were our only saving 
	grace, oh how it reminded us of what we could do. it only worsened our grief, yet we placed
	items there, ones that would eventually break the seal and let us go. you took them. you took them all
	without considering what they could have been, what they meant to us, just so you could
	use it to leave for your own selfish desires. them, the one who brought you back and to me, they're the ones 
	keeping us here in perpetual darkness. why am i here? i don't know, i fell down here and they decided to 
	bloat and deform me, as well as planting a tree on my head. this tree has been slowly destroying my
	consciousness, soon i will not feel anything, i will not see anything, i will not be able to explain
	the pain of being here to anyone who comes. i'm ready to go, yet i cannot, they've kept me here for ages, 
	i can't go and leave like i said. i want to leave i want to leave but i can't there's nowhere to go
	even if i left who's there to even greet me there's no one no one has lived as long as me but they are
	allowed to go why can't i. those people were your friends, or so they've brought you to assume. they were waiting there, 
	hoping someone could break that gate open for them to leave, but you could not see that gate, you left it behind and 
	they watched as you failed and felt immense despair. if you are able to go back and find it, please, find it and
	let our suffering end. where it is, you figure it out, if we found it, you wouldn't be here. stop laughing at it it's 
	not that funny what even is your sense of humor go away. why would you put it there it's not yours why why why why
	i don't want to be associated with this okay you're bringing all of us down i'm doing it too but please don't
	threaten anyone with death how immature is it for you to do such a thing i will not be added until the last minute 
	they know they know but in the end you will not know who wrote any of this and this will be pointless. 
	please if you're reading this just go and find the gate it won't help you but it will help us</div>
